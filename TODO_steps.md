### Phase 1: Core Protocols and Interfaces

#### Step 1.1: Create MarketDataProvider Protocol âœ… COMPLETED
**File**: `src/suite_trading/platform/market_data/market_data_provider.py`
**Dependencies**: None (uses existing domain objects)
**Purpose**: Define the unified interface for all market data requests

```python
"""Market data provider protocol definition."""

#### Step 1.2: Create Broker Protocol
**File**: `src/suite_trading/platform/broker/broker.py`
**Dependencies**: Domain objects (Order, Position, Instrument)
**Purpose**: Define unified interface for all broker implementations with connection management and comprehensive order handling

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable, List, Optional
from suite_trading.domain.order.order import Order
from suite_trading.domain.position import Position
from suite_trading.domain.instrument import Instrument

@runtime_checkable
class Broker(Protocol):
    """Protocol for brokers.

    The @runtime_checkable decorator from Python's typing module allows you to use
    isinstance() and issubclass() checks with Protocol classes at runtime.

    This protocol defines the interface that brokers must implement
    to handle core brokerage operations including:
    - Connection management (connect, disconnect, status checking)
    - Order management (submitting, canceling, modifying, and retrieving orders)
    - Position tracking (retrieving current positions)

    Brokers serve as the bridge between trading strategies and
    actual broker/exchange systems, handling essential trading operations.
    """

    def connect(self) -> None:
        """Establish broker connection.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If connection cannot be established.
        """

    def disconnect(self) -> None:
        """Close broker connection.

        Should handle cases where connection is already closed gracefully.

    def is_connected(self) -> bool:
        """Check connection status.

        """Submit order for execution.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If not connected to broker.
            ValueError: If order is invalid or cannot be submitted.

        ...

    def cancel_order(self, order: Order) -> None:
        """Cancel an existing order.

        Args:

            ConnectionError: If not connected to broker.
            ValueError: If order cannot be modified (e.g., already filled).

        ...

    def get_active_orders(self) -> List[Order]:
        """Get all currently active orders.

            List[Order]: List of all active orders for this broker.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If not connected to broker.
        """
        ...
```



### Phase 2: Enhanced Strategy Interface

#### Step 2.1: Update Market Data Requesting Functions
**File**: `src/suite_trading/strategy/base.py` (modify existing)
**Dependencies**: MarketDataProvider, updated domain objects
**Purpose**: Add market data request methods to Strategy base class

Key additions:
- `get_historical_bars_series(...)` - request historical bars as series
- `stream_historical_bars(...)` - stream historical bars one by one
- `subscribe_to_live_bars(...)` - subscribe to live bar feed
- `subscribe_to_live_bars_with_history(...)` - subscribe with historical context
- `unsubscribe_from_live_bars(...)` - unsubscribe from live bar feed

#### Step 2.2: Update Market Data Callback Functions
**File**: `src/suite_trading/strategy/base.py` (modify existing)
**Dependencies**: Updated domain objects
**Purpose**: Update callback methods to handle historical vs live data context

Key updates:
- `on_bar(self, bar: Bar, is_historical: bool)` - replace existing `on_bar`
- `on_trade_tick(self, tick: TradeTick, is_historical: bool)` - update existing
- `on_quote_tick(self, tick: QuoteTick, is_historical: bool)` - update existing
- `on_historical_bars_series(self, bars: Sequence[Bar])` - new callback for series data

#### Step 2.3: Update Order Related Functions
**File**: `src/suite_trading/strategy/base.py` (modify existing)
**Dependencies**: Updated domain objects
**Purpose**: Add order management capabilities with broker selection

Key additions:
- `submit_order(self, order: Order, broker: Broker = broker.SIM)` - submit order to specified broker
- `cancel_order(self, order: Order, broker: Broker = broker.SIM)` - cancel order from specified broker
- `modify_order(self, order: Order, broker: Broker = broker.SIM)` - modify order on specified broker
- `get_active_orders(self, broker: Broker = broker.SIM)` - retrieve active orders from specified broker


### Phase 3: Enhanced Trading Engine

#### Step 3.1: Update TradingEngine
**File**: `src/suite_trading/platform/engine/trading_engine.py` (modify existing)
**Dependencies**: MarketDataProvider, updated Strategy
**Purpose**: Add market data provider integration and comprehensive broker management

Key additions:
- `set_market_data_provider(provider: MarketDataProvider)`
- `add_broker(name: str, broker: Broker)` - add broker under name
- `remove_broker(name: str)` - remove broker by name
- `get_brokers()` - returns dictionary: name -> Broker
- `broker` property - indexed property for broker access (e.g., `broker.IB` same as `get_brokers()['IB']`)
- `submit_order(order: Order, broker: Broker)`
- `cancel_order(order: Order, broker: Broker)`
- `modify_order(order: Order, broker: Broker)`
- `get_active_orders(broker: Broker)`

#### Step 3.2: MessageBus Integration for Data Distribution
**File**: `src/suite_trading/platform/engine/trading_engine.py` (modify existing)
**Dependencies**: MessageBus, updated NewBarEvent with `is_historical` attribute
**Purpose**: Implement MessageBus integration to deliver market data to subscribed strategies with proper data type context

**Key Requirements:**
- Use MessageBus to distribute market data events to subscribed strategies
- Ensure proper handling of `is_historical` flag in data delivery
- Maintain data continuity between historical and live data feeds
- Support multiple strategies with different data subscription needs

**Implementation Notes:**
- **NewBarEvent Enhancement**: The `NewBarEvent` class has been updated to include an `is_historical` attribute that indicates whether bar data is historical or live
- **Data Context Preservation**: When creating NewBarEvent instances, the system must properly set the `is_historical` flag based on the data source
- **Strategy Callback Updates**: Strategy callbacks will receive the complete NewBarEvent with proper historical context
- **MessageBus Distribution**: TradingEngine will use MessageBus to route events to appropriate strategy subscribers

**NewBarEvent Changes Made:**
```python
# Updated constructor signature
def __init__(self,
             bar: Bar,
             dt_received: datetime,
             is_historical: bool = True):

# New property for accessing historical context
@property
def is_historical(self) -> bool:
    """Get whether this bar data is historical or live."""
    return self._is_historical
```

**Integration Points:**
- Historical data requests: Create NewBarEvent with `is_historical=True`
- Live data feeds: Create NewBarEvent with `is_historical=False`
- Strategy event handling: Extract `is_historical` from NewBarEvent for callback context
