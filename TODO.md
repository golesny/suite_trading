THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM / CHALLENGE, WE HAVE TO SOLVE

### Trading Strategy Data Problem: Getting Market Data in the Right Order

#### ### What Kind of Problem This Is

This is a **timing problem** in trading software. We need to make sure that when a trading strategy gets market data (like stock prices), the data always comes in the right time order - from oldest to newest.

#### ### The Main Problem

Right now, our trading strategies can ask for market data anytime they want using various methods. But this creates a big problem: **the data can arrive out of order**, which breaks how trading strategies are supposed to work.

#### ### What Goes Wrong

##### **Safe Ways to Get Data (These Work Fine)**

**Getting Historical Data Once:**
- ✅ **Works well**: Strategy calls `get_historical_events()` once and gets all the data at the same time
- ✅ **No problems**: The data comes in the right order

**Getting Live Data:**
- ✅ **Works well**: Strategy calls `start_live_stream()` to get new data as it happens in real-time
- ✅ **Natural order**: Live data naturally comes in time order

##### **Dangerous Ways to Get Data (These Cause Problems)**

**Getting Historical Data Multiple Times:**
- ❌ **Big problem**: Strategy can call `stream_historical_events()` for EUR/USD data from January-March, then call it again for GBP/USD data from last year
- ❌ **Time confusion**: Strategy gets newer data first, then older data later
- ❌ **Makes no sense**: It's like going back in time, which breaks trading logic

**Getting Live Data with Historical Data Mixed In:**
- ❌ **Big problem**: Strategy calls `start_live_stream_with_history()` while already getting today's live data, then suddenly gets old data from last month
- ❌ **Time mess**: Strategy doesn't know what time it's supposed to be at
- ❌ **Confusing**: Strategy can't tell if it's looking at old or new information

**Getting Data for Multiple Instruments:**
- ❌ **Critical problem**: Strategy has to call `stream_historical_events()` separately for each instrument (EUR/USD, then GBP/USD, then USD/JPY)
- ❌ **Data arrives mixed up**: EUR/USD data from 9:00 AM might arrive after GBP/USD data from 9:15 AM
- ❌ **Wrong order**: Strategy gets confused about what happened when

#### ### Why This Happens

##### **The Root Problems**

1. **No time rules**: Strategies can call any data method at any time
2. **No order checking**: System doesn't make sure data arrives in time order
3. **Mixed up data**: Historical and live data get mixed together randomly
4. **No time tracking**: Strategy doesn't know what time it's supposed to be at
5. **One instrument at a time**: `stream_historical_events()` can only handle one instrument per call
6. **No coordination**: When calling `stream_historical_events()` for multiple instruments, their data doesn't arrive together in order

##### **Real Example of the Problem**

```
Strategy wants data for 3 instruments starting from January 1st:
- Calls stream_historical_events() for EUR/USD data
- Calls stream_historical_events() for GBP/USD data
- Calls stream_historical_events() for USD/JPY data

What happens:
- EUR/USD data from 9:00 AM arrives
- USD/JPY data from 8:30 AM arrives (this is older!)
- GBP/USD data from 9:15 AM arrives
- More EUR/USD data from 8:45 AM arrives (this is even older!)

Result: Strategy gets completely mixed up about what time things happened
```

##### **What Goes Wrong**

- **Trading logic breaks**: Strategies that depend on time order stop working correctly
- **Testing becomes wrong**: Can't trust historical testing results
- **Hard to debug**: Very difficult to figure out what went wrong
- **Multi-instrument strategies fail**: Strategies that compare different instruments can't work properly
- **Analysis becomes unreliable**: Can't do proper analysis when data is out of order

#### ### What We Need to Fix This

##### **Basic Requirements**

1. **Time always moves forward**: All data must come in time order, from oldest to newest
2. **Clear time boundaries**: Strategy should know if it's looking at historical data or live data
3. **Clean transitions**: When switching from historical to live data, it should be smooth
4. **Strategy knows the time**: Strategy should always know what time it's at
5. **Multiple instruments together**: Should be able to get data for many instruments at once, all in time order
6. **Coordinated delivery**: All instrument data should arrive mixed together in the right time sequence

##### **Requirements for Multiple Instruments**

1. **Ask for many instruments at once**: One request should be able to get data for multiple instruments
2. **Single time-ordered stream**: All instruments should send their data through one channel in time order
3. **Perfect timing**: System makes sure all instrument data arrives in the right time sequence
4. **All-or-nothing**: Either get data for all requested instruments, or none at all

#### ### Possible Solution: Strategy Clock and Timelines

**A promising solution is to give each Strategy its own internal clock and let it manage multiple timelines that automatically stay in sync with this clock.**

##### **How This Would Work**

**1. Strategy Gets Its Own Clock**
- Each strategy has its own timer that tracks what time the strategy thinks it is
- All data must respect this timer
- Time always moves forward, never backward

**2. Timeline System**
- Each timeline represents data for one instrument (like EUR/USD bars or GBP/USD prices)
- All timelines automatically sync with the strategy's clock
- Multiple timelines can work together and deliver data in the right time order
- Can add or remove timelines anytime

**3. Timeline Features**
- **Flexible content**: Each timeline can have different types of data (prices, volumes, etc.)
- **Automatic sync**: All timelines automatically align with the strategy clock
- **Add anytime**: Can add new instrument timelines while strategy is running
- **Limited history**: New timelines added later will have less historical data (which is expected and OK)
- **Perfect order**: System makes sure all timeline data comes in the right time order

##### **Adding and Removing Timelines**

**Adding new instrument data:**
```
Strategy starts and adds EUR/USD timeline at time T1
Later, strategy adds GBP/USD timeline at time T2 (T2 is after T1)
GBP/USD timeline will only have data from T2 onwards (missing T1-T2 period)
This is expected and acceptable
```

**Timeline coordination:**
- All active timelines deliver data in time order relative to strategy clock
- Data from different instruments gets automatically mixed into one time-ordered sequence
- Strategy receives all data in perfect chronological order

**Removing timelines:**
```
Strategy can remove instrument timelines when no longer needed
```

##### **Benefits of This Approach**

**1. Perfect Time Order**
- Strategy clock ensures all data respects time progression
- Impossible to receive out-of-order data
- Clear time reference for all strategy operations

**2. Multiple Instruments Work Together**
- Multiple timelines automatically coordinate through shared strategy clock
- Data from different instruments delivered in correct time sequence
- Single time-ordered flow across all subscribed instruments

**3. Flexible Management**
- Timelines can be added/removed while strategy is running
- Strategy can adapt to changing needs
- Don't need to decide all instruments upfront

**4. Accepts Natural Limitations**
- Clear expectation that later-added timelines will have less history
- Prevents time paradoxes by accepting this natural limitation
- Strategy can make smart decisions about when to add new instruments

**5. Simple to Use**
- Single clock reference eliminates time confusion
- Timeline management provides clear, easy interface
- Automatic coordination reduces complexity for strategy developers

#### ### Success Criteria

A good solution will:

- **Fix time paradoxes**: No strategy can get out-of-order data
- **Keep trading logic working**: Time-based trading strategies work reliably
- **Make development easier**: Clear, predictable time behavior
- **Enable solid testing**: Consistent historical data processing
- **Support live trading**: Smooth transition to real-time operations
- **Sync multiple instruments**: All instruments deliver data in unified time order
- **Enable multi-instrument strategies**: Support for comparing instruments, arbitrage, and portfolio strategies
- **Allow dynamic management**: Can add/remove instruments while strategy is running
- **Keep time clarity**: Strategy always knows what time it's at
- **Handle limitations gracefully**: Accept that later-added instruments will have less history

This problem needs a complete redesign that puts time consistency first, making sure trading strategies always operate in a logical time environment across all the instruments they're watching. The current methods like `stream_historical_events()`, `start_live_stream_with_history()`, and others need to be rethought to prevent the chronological ordering issues that break trading strategy logic.
