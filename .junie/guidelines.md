# Project Overview

We are building a modern algorithmic trading framework in Python that allows:
- Backtesting strategies with historical data
- Running live strategies

# Core Development Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Always prefer the simplest possible working solution
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Only implement things when actually needed
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Every piece of knowledge should have a single representation
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer composition over inheritance hierarchies
- **Fail Fast**: Detect errors early and report them immediately
- **Intuitive Domain Model**: Create a simple, understandable domain model
- **Broker Agnostic**: Framework should be broker agnostic where possible

# Coding Standards

## Dataclasses

- Always use `ClassVar` from `typing` module to explicitly mark class variables in dataclasses

## Documentation

- Use Google documentation style for all docstrings
- Format docstrings with content on separate lines
- Include purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions in function docstrings
- Include type information for all parameters, return values, and attributes in docstrings

# Testing Guidelines

- Don't generate tests unless explicitly asked
- Use `pytest` library (not `unittest`)
- Test function names should start with "test_" and describe what they're testing
- Organize tests in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Mirror the package structure of the code they test
- Keep only the root `tests/__init__.py` file

# Git Commit Guidelines

- Write commits in **imperative mood** (like giving a command)
  - **✅ Good:** "Add user authentication" 
  - **❌ Avoid:** "Added user authentication"
- Keep subject line concise (50 chars or less)
- Start with capital letter, no period at end
- Use present tense imperative verbs: Add, Fix, Remove, Update
- Be descriptive about what and why
- For longer commits, add body separated by blank line
