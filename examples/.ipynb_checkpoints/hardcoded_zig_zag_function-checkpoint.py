    """
    Generate a value following a zig-zag pattern that alternates between price increases and decreases.

    This function creates a zig-zag pattern where prices rise by a fixed increment for a specified
    number of steps, then fall by the same increment for another specified number of steps, and repeat.
    Each peak and trough is represented by exactly one point.
    The sequence length is the sum of count_rising_steps and count_falling_steps.
    Each cycle starts at a value that's increment higher than the start of the previous cycle.

    Args:
        x: Position in the sequence (x-value in the zig-zag pattern)
        start_price: Starting price value (price when x = 0)
        increment: Fixed increment to add/subtract at each step
        count_rising_steps: Number of steps in the rising phase
        count_falling_steps: Number of steps in the falling phase

    Returns:
        A float value representing the price at the given position
